# To what extent does the impact of socioeconomic disparities on European students differ with regard to gender?
## 1.	Problem overview 
The idea to research this problem stems from personal experiences within our group, where repeatedly in families experiencing financial challenges, female students were more likely to struggle with socio-economic barriers than males. Often dealing with societal expectations or cultural norms hindering their educational process. Past research has shown this phenomenon to have an impact on numeracy test results leading to gender gaps as early as grade 3[^1]. 

With our analysis we want to explore whether such disparities also exist among European students, especially when attaining higher education. While in general the majority of bachelor and master students are female[^2] , we suspect this to change among students in weaker socio-economic positions. This data exploration aims to provide a basic understanding of the interplay of gender and socio-economic status in students educational attainment. Within our research, we will encounter two of the 17 SDGs, part of the “Agenda 2030” set out by the United Nations. “SDG 4: Quality Education” as well as “SDG 5: Gender Equality”, further emphasizes the importance of the subject. 
## 2.	Project goals 
The project uses a dataset made by eurostudent.eu to analyze how different aspects of the socioeconomic background influence the attainment of European students. For that we search for correlations and trends with a focus on gender-specific differences. Ultimately, we want to raise understanding and awareness of the disparities and interactions between gender and socio-economic status we may encounter.

## 3.	Data source 
For the project a dataset found at https://database.eurostudent.eu/drm/ will be used, which provides information on student characteristics in 25 European countries. We will concentrate on using the table that divides the students by gender to compare the different results. This table has 25 rows (countries) and 1045 columns, of which around 377 columns are worth looking at for our research question. In total the table has 2950 missing values. For further analysis we might also link this dataset to another dataset of the same website, which contains information about the socio-economic background of students in the 25 European countries.
